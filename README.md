# Data-Visualization-Project
research on airbnb data

All of the codes are written by ourselves. The library we are using is D3.js. 

The data visualization includes:

1.	Geographic map showing neighborhoods in New York city 
2.	Color scale performed on circle elements representing Airbnb properties
3.	Brushing on scatterplot matrix, serving as the interactive feature between scatterplot matrix and geographic map
4.	Double clicked zoom in and zoom out on geographic map

We provide several data files with different sizes. What we currently are using is called ‘Airbnb_2019_shuffle’, which contains about 3800 objects. Users can switch between different data files.
