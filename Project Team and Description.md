# Data Visualization Final Project Proposal
### Team Member:
* Liu Wu, Heying Yu, Jiayao Wang

### Project Description:
* The project will focus on the visualization and analysis of the New York City Airbnb Dataset. This data file includes all the needed information to find out more about hosts, geographical availability, necessary metrics to make predictions and draw conclusions. We would like to find out the relationships between the attributes of Airbnb, such as what are the important contributors to the price and what attributes the customers most care about.
